Simulation of Three Door Monty Hall problem

The Three-Door Monty Hall problem is a probability brain teaser. The problem puts you in a game show, in which the host
asks you to choose among three doors. Behind two doors, there is a goat. Behind one, there is a brand-new Ferrari.
Once you pick a door, the host, aware of which door is which, opens a different door to reveal a goat. They then give
you the option to stick to your previous choice or to switch doors. 

The question is: Is the Ferrari more likely behind the door you picked previously or behind the other?
